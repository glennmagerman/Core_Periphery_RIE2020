# Pecking Order and Core-Periphery in International Trade

This repository contains all codes to replicate the empirical results in "Pecking Order and Core-Periphery in International Trade", Review of International Economics (2020), by Glenn Magerman, Karolien De Bruyne and Jan Van Hove.

Feel free to send a line to [glenn.magerman@ulb.be](glenn.magerman@ulb.be) for any questions or comments.

Data for the project is obtained from the following sources:
  1. Gravity data from [BACI/CEPII](http://www.cepii.fr/cepii/en/bdd_modele/presentation.asp?id=1)
  2. GDP from [World Bank WDI](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD)
  3. GDP deflator from [multpl](http://www.multpl.com/gdp-deflator/table) (for some measures tracked over time)
  4. GDP per capita from [World Bank WDI](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD)
  5. Geographic data from [CEPII](http://www.cepii.fr/cepii/en/bdd_modele/presentation.asp?id=6)
  6. Regional Trade Agreements data from [EWF](http://www.ewf.uni-bayreuth.de/en/research/RTA-data/index.html)
  7. WTO membership data from [WTO](www.wto.org) (self constructed from tables)
			
All code is written in Stata, R and Gephi, and all do-files are available in this repo.
After downloading the relevant datasets, run the relevant files.

Some important notes:
  1. You might need a Comtrade license to get access to the BACI/CEPII trade datasets.
  2. Gephi does not support coding, so the final results you obtain might be different from the ones we created in the paper.
